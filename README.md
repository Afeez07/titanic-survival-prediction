# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using logistic regression. It walks through the full data science pipeline: from data cleaning and visualization to model evaluation and interpretation.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **EDA & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, visualizing distributions, encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables to improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Training a logistic regression classifier.
- **Evaluation**: Analyzing accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Model Performance

- Classifier: Logistic Regression  
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix  
- Outcome: Achieved 78% accuracy on the validation set.

## 📝 Key Insights

- Female passengers had a significantly higher chance of survival.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in lower classes.
- Fare price and family size had a moderate influence on survival odds.

## 🚀 How to Run
